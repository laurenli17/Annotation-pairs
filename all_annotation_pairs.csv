You can buy either frozen lobster tails or claws. It's rare to find a frozen whole lobster that has not been pre-cooked. Warm-water lobsters, also known as spiny lobster, are not as tasty because the meat can become mushy. These originate from Latin America, the Caribbean, and Florida. The tails from the Caribbean have yellow spots and tails with yellow bands. The meat in cold water lobster, also known as Maine lobster, is more desirable. It’s whiter, sweeter and more tender. However, it can also be more expensive. Cold-water lobsters come from South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and, Northeast America. If the store doesn’t know whether the tails came from cold water, less expensive is usually indicative of the warm-water variety. Frozen lobster claws contain less meat than as tails and thus are less expensive. You can find them in the frozen food section of many grocery stores.

Thus, when planning the slope, begin with what will be the highest point. Typically, this is the point at the bottom of the front door or otherwise closest to the house. Drive a stake at the high point, and mark the correct height where the pavers will meet the door or structure. Tie a string around the stake at that height. Drive a stake (if there isn't already one) at the outer boundary of your project. This will be your lowest point. Attach a line level to your string and then tie the loose end of the string around the outer stake at the height at which the line level tells you the entire string is level. Now from that line move down the stake at least 1/8"" per linear foot (e.g. if it is 8 feet from your front door to the outer edge of your patio, move down the stake 1""), and draw a new line. Move your string down to this line. String cross-lines down the length of the project to ensure you mark the correct depth across the entire project. If your project area has a variety of slopes, or if your design is irregular, you'll need to repeat this process in several points.

Putting physical barriers like a pool fence between your children and your pool can often be enough to keep them out of it when you're not there to supervise them. Young children are attracted to pools and don't understand the danger. Below are just a few basic ideas for kid-proofing your pool: Keep ground-level pools fenced off with an at least 4 feet high fence. Use play pens, iron, chain link or mesh pool fences to form a protective barrier around your pool. Use a self-closing, self-locking pool gate. If you don't have a self-closing gate, be sure to lock any gates or doors in the fencing after swimming Remove ladders for above-ground pools. If your children are too small to climb into above-ground pools without a ladder, simply take the ladder away to keep them out. If possible, use a cover or lid for your pool. Many pools and hot tubs come with hard lids or plastic covers. Usually, these are used for weatherproofing the pool when not in use, but they can also be an effective deterrent against children if they're sturdy enough to keep them out. Always ensure the spa and pool covers are working, and the walkways surfaces such as diving boards, ladders, decks are non-slippery. Replace or reinforce in case there is a wear out. To avoid injuries in the pool, cover all sharp edges and raised hard surfaces. Keep all electrical devices away from the spa or pool to avoid electrical shock. Ensure all the wiring are maintained and are installed professionally.

Ostrich ferns (Matteuccia struthiopteris) are commonly grown ferns with rhizomatous roots. Once the soil is washed off, the fern’s roots may appear as a mass of fine, fibrous roots growing from the center of the fern. These are clump-forming roots. Royal fern (Osmunda regalis) is one of the fern species that has a clump-forming root system.

You can also let it air dry until you can take the garment off and clean it further. Use a dry and clean cloth, napkin, or towel to gently blot at the fabric. There may be some visible residue of the solution after it’s dry, which will go away when you wash it later. You should use a damp cloth or napkin to further remove residue of the solution if the treated area of your garment will be exposed to sunlight. This will prevent any lightening that may occur with sun exposure.

Adding the last ingredient really stirs things up. Here's why: Salt sinks down to the bottom of the bottle, dragging a blob of oil with it. Once the salt breaks up and dissolves in the water, the oil floats up to the top again. The fizzy tablet reacts with the water to make tiny bubbles of carbon dioxide gas. These bubbles attach themselves to the blobs of colored water and float up to the surface.

Conduct practice drills to ensure that all members of the community are clear about what they need to do and where they need to go during a safety evacuation. Include a plan that can ensure a head count of every single member of the community; ensure that assistance for disabled or ill persons can be provided. Ensure that warning and evacuation signals are understood by the community in advance — distribute pamphlets or give lectures to ensure that everybody is aware. Read Understand Tsunami Notification Terms.

And if you throw on some cheese, and a second slice of toasted bread, you can even turn it into a grilled cheese sandwich.

918,"Use a “weather struck” bed joint for exposed walls. If your wall is in an exposed area where it will receive a lot of wind, rain, or snow, you can use a weather struck joint. To make a weather struck bed joint, press your pointing trowel at an angle, so that the top edge is indented into the mortar and the lower edge is away from the wall. Then run the trowel along the mortar and press the joint into shape. A weather struck joint will protect your brick wall from absorbing water. The angle of the joint will deflect moisture and force rainwater to run down the surface of the bricks, rather than soaking into the mortar. Weather struck joints are only used on bed joints. There is no corresponding pointing angle for vertical joints. For a professional finish, smooth out the joint and surrounding area with a medium-soft mason brush when it's about halfway dry. Wait for the mortar to fully dry after this step.

940,"Look for frost-prone parts of the garden. If you live where frosts occur, it is worthwhile assessing the frost-prone areas of your garden, as there are bound to be some parts that are more at risk than others. This matters when determining where to plant frost-fragile and frost-hardy plants. Look for frost pockets. These occur in depressions, dips, dells, downhill, lower valley areas, hollows, or where blockages occur, such as where there is a wall, hedge, or a building that stops the downhill movement of cold air and causes it to pool in one place. Avoid growing early flowering plants in frost pockets. If there are barriers such as fences or walls, small holes in them can help to allow the air to keep circulating rather than pooling and becoming frosty.",What if I live where frosts occur?,"It is worthwhile assessing the frost-prone areas of your garden, as there are bound to be some parts that are more at risk than others.",Where are frost pockets?,"These occur in depressions, dips, dells, downhill, lower valley areas, hollows, or where blockages occur, such as where there is a wall, hedge, or a building that stops the downhill movement of cold air and causes it to pool in one place.",What should I avoid?,Avoid growing early flowering plants in frost pockets.,,,,,,,

945,"Prime the cabinets. If you plan to use paint to refinish your cabinets, they will need to be primed first. Primers are paint products formulated allow new paint to bond with the old paint below it. The primer seals the wood, covering any blemishes, stains, knots, or anything else whose color might leech into the final paint coat. Here is a quick primer on primer: Do you need to prime? If you are painting an unfinished surface, whether wood, drywall, concrete, or metal, needs to be primed before it is painted. Pick the right primer. Many primers today will work on anything—ask the pros at the paint store what they recommend. A good rule of thumb is to match the primer with the paint: a shellac primer over latex paint, and an oil primer over oil paint. An exception to this would be applying water-based products over oil-based. This will not work. Painting oil over latex? The question has been asked 1,000 times, whether it's ok to paint latex over oil, or oil over latex. The answer depends on who you ask, but the bottom line is this: properly prepped, you can paint anything over anything. Prepare your surface properly by cleaning and sanding and cleaning again, then apply a primer.The key is making sure that the surface that is being primed doesn't have a gloss, as paint—especially latex, will not stick to a glossy base, and you'll have a much harder job to do in fairly short order. Read the label of the bonding primer carefully. Check to see if it will bond latex to oil.",What are primers?,Primers are paint products formulated allow new paint to bond with the old paint below it.,What can primers be used for?,"The primer seals the wood, covering any blemishes, stains, knots, or anything else whose color might leech into the final paint coat.",How to choose the correct primer?,"Many primers today will work on anything—ask the pros at the paint store what they recommend.

Originally you had a chicken drumstick for each diner or a steak for each person. Not anymore––resort to chopping the meat up into smaller portions and turn these pieces of meat into a dish. Either turn the pieces into a stir-fry, curry, stew or pot pie (simply add pastry over the top and a cheesy sauce as filler) or serve the pieces rather than the whole if this can pulled off without looking stingy. Neatly chopping the meat can give the impression that it is meant to be served that way, rather than whole. Add plenty of vegetables and perhaps a dollop of couscous or Aquino, which both cook quickly and supplement the protein.
